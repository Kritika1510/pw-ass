    "Q1. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple and intuitive supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. In KNN, the prediction for a new data point is determined by the majority class (for classification) or the average value (for regression) of its K nearest neighbors in the feature space. The distance metric, typically Euclidean distance, is used to measure the similarity between data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. The choice of the value of K in KNN is crucial as it significantly affects the algorithm's performance. To choose the optimal value of K, you can use techniques such as cross-validation, grid search, or experimentation with different values of K. A smaller value of K can lead to high variance and overfitting, while a larger value of K can result in high bias and underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. The main difference between KNN classifier and KNN regressor lies in their prediction tasks:\n",
    "- KNN Classifier: It predicts the class label of a new data point based on the majority class among its K nearest neighbors.\n",
    "- KNN Regressor: It predicts the continuous value of a new data point by averaging the values of its K nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. The performance of KNN can be measured using various evaluation metrics depending on the task:\n",
    "- For classification tasks, common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.\n",
    "- For regression tasks, common metrics include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. The curse of dimensionality in KNN refers to the phenomenon where the performance of the algorithm deteriorates as the number of dimensions ("
